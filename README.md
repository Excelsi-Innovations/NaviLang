# NaviLang

> A modern, human-centered programming language for building reactive, distributed systems with clarity and speed.  
> Define system logic, workflows, APIs, and documentation in a visual-first, declarative format.  
> **Open Source Core â€” Extensible Platform.**

## ðŸ§­ What is NaviLang?

**NaviLang** is a **declarative language** designed to describe and visualize system logic, flows, services, APIs, and architectures â€” in a modular, readable, and human-first way.

Think of it as **Markdown for system design** â€” with the ability to **transform text prompts into diagrams** and executable structures.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Declarative syntax** â€” readable like natural language
- **Visual output** â€” auto-generates diagrams (Mermaid, SVG, or canvas)
- **Modular contexts** â€” isolate services/domains (`CONTEXT auth`, `CONTEXT payment`)
- **Composable systems** â€” describe how parts interact, flow, and respond
- **Integrated docs** â€” document endpoints, data, or decisions inline (`DOCS`)
- **Drag & drop interface** (optional) â€” edit logic visually like Figma
- **Team collaboration** â€” multiple people can work on isolated flows
- **Cross-domain use** â€” APIs, microservices, UIs, workflows, infrastructure

## ðŸš€ Example (WIP Syntax)

```navilang
CONTEXT auth
  VAR User
  VAR Token
  ACTION Login
    GOES TO ValidateCredentials
    GOES TO GenerateToken -> Token
    GOES TO RETURN Token

  DOCS Login
    - Accepts: User credentials
    - Returns: Access Token
